<body><h1>Hello World! This is where I keep my projects alive.</h1>
<p>Most of my projects are from tutorials given by Brackeys.  I started learning Javascript and Python, but it was really dry
  and was easy to get distracted with so many paths to take.  It was like watching a tv series that never ended.  Then I found game development to be
  like a movie where once I dedicate a few hours and I would have a working prototype.</p>
  <p> So now I am interested in the AR and VR mountain of work, since there is still a long way to go, I want to jump in and see
    how big of a splash I can make.</p>
