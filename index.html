  <h1>Install and configure ownCloud</h1>
      <p>Installing and configuring the appliance is the easiest way to get ownCloud up and running and is best for non-technical users. 
	It is built on UCS ("Univention Corporate Server") and is fully set up and configured with a secure connection and the ownCloud 
	Proxy app. You can install virtual box, download our OVA file and load it up. </p>
