<h1>Install and configure ownCloud</h1>
<p>
Installing and configuring the appliance is the easiest way to get ownCloud up and running and is best for non-technical users. 
It is built on UCS ("Univention Corporate Server") and is fully set up and configured with a secure connection and the ownCloud 
Proxy app. You can install virtual box, download our OVA file and load it up.

<p>
Before you download and install ownServer we recommend you refer to [View the markdown used to create this post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barryclark/www.jekyllnow.com/gh-pages/_posts/2014-6-19-Markdown-Style-Guide.md) to see which scenario best suits your needs.
