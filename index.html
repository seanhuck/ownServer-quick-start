<h1>Install and configure ownCloud</h1>
<p>
Installing and configuring the appliance is the easiest way to get ownCloud up and running and is best for non-technical users. 
It is built on UCS ("Univention Corporate Server") and is fully set up and configured with a secure connection and the ownCloud 
Proxy app. You can install virtual box, download our OVA file and load it up. 
</p>
<p>
Before you download and install ownServer we recommend you refer to 
[Deployment Recommendations](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/installation/deployment_recommendations.html#general-recommendations/) to see which scenario best suits your needs.
